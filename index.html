      <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
        Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named
        for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
        several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.
