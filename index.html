      <p>
        A croissant is a buttery, flaky, French viennoiserie pastry inspired by the shape of the
        Austrian kipferl but using the French yeast-leavened laminated dough. Croissants are named
        for their historical crescent shape, the dough is layered with butter, rolled and folded
        several times in succession, then rolled into a thin sheet, in a technique called
        laminating. The process results in a layered, flaky texture, similar to a puff pastry.

        The first step of manufacturing croissants is the "predough" formation. To prepare predough,
        flour, water, in-dough fat, yeast, salt, and sugar are mixed together in a single step.
        Typically, croissant predough is mixed in a relatively cool environment, for a longer time
        than other pastries. The ideal temperature of the dough should be around 19°C, to best
        hydrate the ingredients. In comparison to the mixing of bread dough ingredients, pastry
        predough is considered underdeveloped in that mixing is stopped as soon as the dough appears
        homogeneous, to allow for further dough development in the next step.
